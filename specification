Root tag is <dialogue>.
Each line is encapsulated in <line>.

Portrait is the name of the sprite without extension, I've currently kept them to 256x256 but it doesn't really matter.
Text is obvious. Char limit depends on resolution with current UI system, because I'm terrible at UI.
	* Speed is the amount of seconds between each letter being typed - so 10 like in the last example of scene1.xml is agonisingly slow.
	* Name is the name that will appear in a separate text field. Not yet implemeneted.
