Portrait is the name of the sprite without extension, I've currently kept them to 256x256 but it doesn't really matter.
Text is obvious. Char limit seems to be around the 260-270 range but keep it under 220 to be safe, I'd say. It probably varies depending on resolution for now though.
Speed is the amount of seconds between each letter being typed - so 10 like in the last example is agonisingly slow.
